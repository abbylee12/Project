##Target Audience

For my app, my target are people who are looking to the University 
of Charleston to play basketball.

#Observation
I noticed that a lot of new people on the team did not know much
about what they were getting themselves into. They did not know anything 
about their teammates, what there is to do around Charleston, WV, and so 
on.

## Idea

For my app idea, I want to create an app that my basketball coaches 
could send to recruits to help them learn more about our program. 
One of the things I learned coming into college for sports, is that I never 
real knew what I was getting myself into. I came for a visit at UC, 
but I did not really get to talk to any of the players on the team about 
their experiences, why they chose to play here, and so on. 


## Solution

The first thing I want to do is interview all of my teammates about why 
they chose to come to UC, their experiences while here, and create a profile 
of each player and why they chose to play basketball here. 
I'll add the team's rooster, share the schedule, and discuss about 
interesting things to do in Charleston as I gather information on each player. 
I think this would be a pretty interesting tool for my coaches to give to 
recruits since they'd be able to learn why players choose this school over 
others and what they can do in the city.

#Metrics
Do the new recruits know more about the team?
Do they know what it is like playing a sport in college?
