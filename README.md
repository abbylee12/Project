# University of Charleston Women's Basketball App

## Target Audience
For my app, my target audience are people who are looking to the University 
of Charleston to play basketball.

## Persona
Here are three different people on our team:
1.	Our team manager is Lauren Roush. She decided not to play basketball in college but
      still wanted to be engaged with the sport in some manner, so she asked our 
      coaches if she could be our manager, and they said yes. Here is what she thinks 
      about UC:
      >“I chose the University of Charleston because it was close to home and it had a
      small town environment. With a smaller environment it allows you to be more
      involved and build relationships with your teachers, peers, and community.
      With being at UC, my eyes have been opened to diverse backgrounds and environments.
      I am very involved in academic, athletics, and clubs. I would choose the
      University of Charleston one hundred times over again because it has allowed
      me to better prepare myself for my future plans and goals.”
2.	I asked one of my teammates, Anna Cardwell, to tell me her thoughts about why
      she chose UC, and this is what she said: 
      >“The university feels like home to me, which is why I opted to come here. 
      The campus and class sizes are ideal. I always wanted to establish a 
      relationship with all of my teachers while picking which school to attend, 
      and that's exactly what you get here. Then I opted to play 
      basketball here since I was leaving my family and was hundreds of 
      miles away, and being a part of a team allowed me to have a second family."
3.  I asked another on of my teammates, Sierra Davis, her thoughts about UC. She says:
      >"I like UC because the people are different. Being from Utah and the west coast,
      there wasn’t a lot I was very excited about being here in West Virginia.
      It’s like right in the middle being on the east coast but like it’s still
      not on the east coast enough. But something I’ve learned to love is the hospitality
      and kindness of the people who live here. Getting hellos from people you have never
      seen is a normality. You get called baby and honey by all of the older woman.
      Though being away from home is really hard for me, UC isn’t short of kind
      people who are willing to talk and love you."


## Observation
I noticed that a lot of new people on the team did not know much
about what they were getting themselves into. They did not know anything 
about their teammates, what there is to do around Charleston, WV, and so 
on.

# Idea
For my app idea, I want to create an app that my basketball coaches 
could send to recruits to help them learn more about our program. 
One of the things I learned coming into college for sports, is that I never 
really knew what I was getting myself into. I came for a visit at UC, 
but I did not really get to talk to any of the players on the team about 
their experiences, why they chose to play here, and so on.


## Solution
The first thing I want to do is interview all of my teammates about why 
they chose to come to UC, their experiences while being here, and create a profile 
of each player and why they chose to play basketball here. 
I'll add the team's roster: [https://ucgoldeneagles.com/sports/womens-basketball/roster], 
**something like this** , share the schedule:
[https://ucgoldeneagles.com/sports/womens-basketball/schedule], **and something like this** ,
and discuss about interesting things to do in Charleston as I gather information 
on each player. I think this would be a pretty interesting tool for my coaches to give to 
recruits since they'd be able to learn why players choose this school over 
others and what they can do while being here at UC.

## Metrics
1. Do the new recruits know more about the team?
2. Do they know what it is like playing a sport in college
      **I can test these by simply asking them when they
   get here if they know more things about each person
   and ask if the app really helped their knowledge about
   playing a sport in college.**
