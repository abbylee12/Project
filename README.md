### Target Audience

For my app, my target are people who are looking to the University 
of Charleston to play basketball.

## Observation
I noticed that a lot of new people on the team did not know much
about what they were getting themselves into. They did not know anything 
about their teammates, what there is to do around Charleston, WV, and so 
on.

### Idea

For my app idea, I want to create an app that my basketball coaches 
could send to recruits to help them learn more about our program. 
One of the things I learned coming into college for sports, is that I never 
real knew what I was getting myself into. I came for a visit at UC, 
but I did not really get to talk to any of the players on the team about 
their experiences, why they chose to play here, and so on. 

### Persona
Here are three different people on our team:
1.	Lauren is our team manager. She chose not to play basketball in college, 
      but still wanted to be involved in some way, so she asked to be our manger. 
      This is what she says towards attending the University of Charleston: 
      “I chose the University of Charleston because it was close to home and it had a 
      small town environment. With a smaller environment it allows you to be more 
      involved and build relationships with your teachers, peers, and community. 
      With being at UC, my eyes have been opened to diverse backgrounds and environments. 
      I am very involved in academic, athletics, and clubs. I would choose the 
      University of Charleston one hundred times over again because it has allowed 
      me to better prepare myself for my future plans and goals.”
2.	I asked one of my teammates, Anna, to tell me their thoughts about why 
      she chose UC, and this is what she said: “
3.



### Solution

The first thing I want to do is interview all of my teammates about why 
they chose to come to UC, their experiences while here, and create a profile 
of each player and why they chose to play basketball here. 
I'll add the team's rooster, share the schedule, and discuss about 
interesting things to do in Charleston as I gather information on each player. 
I think this would be a pretty interesting tool for my coaches to give to 
recruits since they'd be able to learn why players choose this school over 
others and what they can do in the city.

## Metrics
Do the new recruits know more about the team?
Do they know what it is like playing a sport in college?
